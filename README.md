# FinalProject
Final project in Computer Science B.Sc.


Project overview:

It’s a math gaming project that discusses the Grundy’s Game, explaining what happens when we change the rules of the game 
and showing the difference between the results of the original game of Grundy and the new one.


Grundy's game:

 this game is an impartial combinatorial game played by two players. The starting configuration is a single heap of objects, and the two players take turn splitting a single heap into two heaps of different sizes. The game ends when only heaps of size two and smaller remain, none of which can be split unequally. The game is usually played as a normal play game, which means that the last person who can make an allowed move wins. 


My New Rule of the game:

Rather than the rule which is splitting the heap into two different heaps of two different sizes, I added another one that says that at least one of these sizes must be even.
